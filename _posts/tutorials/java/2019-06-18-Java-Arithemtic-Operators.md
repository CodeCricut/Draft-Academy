## <br/> Arithmetic Operators Overview

In Java, or any programming language, really, we need a way to manipulate variables. While declaring them and never touching them again gives you some functionality, the real fun comes when you have *dynamic* variables. 

Changing varibles in Java is very similar to how you change numbers in algebra. For example, to add two numbers in math, you might write "2 + 2". As you would expect, this equals four. The same syntax is used when changing variables in Java. You could declare the sum of these two numbers as a varible. For example:

```java
int sum = 2 + 2;
```

You aren't limited to using numbers that you typed out, though. You can also use variables:

```java
int num1 = 2;
int num2 = 3;
int sum = num1 + num2;
```

The ability for you to use variables opens up a ton of possibilities.
